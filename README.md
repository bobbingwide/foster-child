Creates a child theme for a Full Site Editing theme

### Requirements
- To be able to create a Full Site Editing child theme based on an existing FSE theme.
- If the existing theme is already a child theme then create a new theme using the theme.json file 
- If the existing theme is not a child theme then start with an empty theme.json file
- UI to allow the user to define the standard things needed in `style.css` 
- Add logic to support the required fonts
- If run from a hosting server deliver a zip file that can be downloaded
- If run in a local install then install it in the theme's folder 

That seems to be enough for the time being.
Wonder how easy it's going to be?
